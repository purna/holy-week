    summary: `On Tuesday morning, Nisan 12, Jesus returned to the Temple courts for His most intensive day of public teaching. The religious leadership — stung by the Temple cleansing the day before and alarmed by the growing crowds — mounted a coordinated series of challenges designed to discredit Him publicly. They sent Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, and scribes in waves. Each trap backfired. Each time, Jesus's answer not only escaped the trap but turned the tables, exposing the questioner's hypocrisy, ignorance, or bad faith. By afternoon, 'no one dared ask him any more questions' (Matthew 22:46).`,
    significance: `The authority question ('By what authority do you do these things?') was the most direct challenge. Jesus answered with a counter-question about John the Baptist's authority that left them publicly paralysed — they couldn't say divine, because they hadn't believed John; they couldn't say human, because the crowd would be furious. Their own trap snapped shut on them. Jesus then delivered three devastating parables against them (the Two Sons, the Wicked Tenants, the Wedding Banquet) followed by the Parable of the Cornerstone — quoting Psalm 118:22 directly at them.`,
    historicalNote: `The 'Temple courts' (Greek: hieron) referred to the vast outer courts of Herod's Temple complex — particularly the Court of the Gentiles. This was a public, noisy, commercially active space where teachers would gather disciples and debate. Jesus taught here daily during Passion Week. The size of the audience made public defeats deeply humiliating for the religious leaders.`,

Jesus's counter-question about John's authority was strategic — if John was God's messenger (Malachi 3:1), and John had publicly identified Jesus as the Coming One (John 1:29–34), then Jesus's authority derived from the very God who had sent His messenger ahead. The leaders were trapped.",

  intro: `It is Tuesday morning, Nisan 12. The Temple courts are packed with Passover pilgrims and local worshippers. Jesus is teaching when a delegation of chief priests, scribes, and elders arrives — formally and deliberately. Their challenge is direct: 'By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?' Three religious leaders were the primary challengers that morning, each representing a different faction. But as you gather evidence from the scene, a question emerges: who is really on trial here — Jesus, or them?`,
