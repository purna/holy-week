=== start ===
Two men came for my donkey colt this morning. They said "The Lord needs it." I knew exactly what that meant. I've had the words of Zechariah 9:9 on my wall for twenty years. "Your king comes, riding on a donkey." You think I was going to say no?
* [Why did you keep the colt untrained?] -> set_apart
* [The rope was cut, not untied.] -> rope_question

=== set_apart ===
I've had that colt set apart since it was born. Never let anyone ride it. Some things you hold in reserve for the right moment.
* [And this was the moment.] -> palm_reveal
* [What about the cloaks?] -> cloak_reveal

=== rope_question ===
The rope was cut? I didn't cut it — I untied the knot myself and handed the colt to them. Someone else must have cut it after. I wasn't watching the post after they left.
* [Then who?] -> palm_reveal
* [You seem very certain about the prophecy.] -> set_apart

=== cloak_reveal ===
I saw those cloaks go by — they used them as a saddle. That's also from the old accounts. When kings are anointed, people give what they have. It's an act of honour. The people were laying thier clocks on the grouns.
* [And the palm branches?] -> palm_reveal
* [That confirms royal intention.] -> scroll_reveal

=== scroll_reveal ===
That scroll fragment in the tent? It's mine. My grandfather gave it to me. Zechariah 9:9 — we always believed that a day would come when those words walked off the page and into history. I believe today was that day.
* [Tell me about the crowd's reaction.] -> crowd_reveal

=== palm_reveal ===
The palms. People waving them as Jesus went by on the donkey.  — that brought tears to my eyes. In the days of the Maccabees, palms meant liberation. Those people understood the language of what was happening.
* [And the cloaks?] -> cloak_reveal
* [This wasn't random.] -> scroll_reveal

=== crowd_reveal ===
The Pharisees' complaint says "the whole world has gone after him." If even they say that — perhaps they're right. Perhaps they just don't know what to do with it.
* [But you do.] -> closing

=== closing ===
When they said those words, I felt it in my chest. This was the day. I told them: "Take him. Give him whatever he needs." Then I walked down to the road to watch, and I wept. This was not a theft. This was the fulfilment of what I've been waiting for my entire life.
