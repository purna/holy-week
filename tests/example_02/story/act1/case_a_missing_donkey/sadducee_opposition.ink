// ============================================================
// CHARACTER: Eleazar ben Simon (Sadducean Aristocrat)
// ACT: Act I
// CASE: The Missing Donkey
// CASE EXPORT: triumphal_entry
// SOURCE: act1_case_2d.js → SUSPECT 'sadducee_noble' (Eleazar ben Simon)
// BIBLE REFERENCE: Acts 5:17 (Sadducean opposition context)
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// PROPHECIES FULFILLED IN THIS CASE:
//   - Psalm 2:2
//     Gospel: Luke 22:66-71 — The Sanhedrin's conspiracy against Jesus
//     Insight: The psalmist foresaw the rulers of this earth taking counsel against the Lord and His anointed. Eleazar represents this opposition, using legal maneuvers to create a security threat.
//   - Isaiah 53:9
//     Gospel: Matthew 27:12-26 — Jesus's trial before the Sanhedrin
//     Insight: The suffering servant was to be 'numbered with the transgressors' and 'buried with the rich.' The Sadducean opposition played their part in fulfilling prophecy.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// BIBLICAL CONTEXT:
//   Summary: Eleazar ben Simon, a wealthy Sadducean aristocrat, witnessed the triumphal entry and filed a perjured deposition claiming the donkey was stolen. This created legal grounds for Roman intervention.
//   Insight: The deposition conflicts with physical evidence (the Shepherd's hitch knot was untied, not hacked). Eleazar's false testimony reveals the depth of opposition to Jesus's kingly claims.

Look at the state of these streets. Palm branches, mud, and Galileans shouting enough to wake the Governor in Caesarea.
* [You seem displeased with the procession.] -> disdain
* [I'm investigating the missing donkey from Bethphage.] -> donkey_claim
=== disdain ===
Displeased? It's a security tinderbox! And the "King" they're following? He's riding a stolen animal.
* [Stolen? The owner says he lent it.] -> donkey_claim
=== donkey_claim ===
Lent it? Hah! I saw two rough-looking men hacking at the tether with rusted knives. They practically dragged the poor beast over the wall while the owner cried out.
* [The rope fibers don't show marks of hacking.] -> pressure
* [The owner had a scroll of Zechariah.] -> fanatical
=== pressure ===
The light was poor at dawn! But I heard the owner shouting for help!
* [The villager says he nodded and let them go.] -> exposed
=== fanatical ===
The owner is a dreamer. He probably thinks every bird that flies over his field is an angel. His testimony is worthless.
* [Continue.] -> pressure
=== exposed ===
Fine! The owner is a fool who gave his property away. But we cannot have people claiming royal titles unvetted. I told the guards it was theft to ensure they would intervene. Order is more important than your "truth."

I have a meeting at the Temple. Do not block my way.
