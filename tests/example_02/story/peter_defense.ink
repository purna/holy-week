=== start ===
I am Simon Peter. I do not count words when answers were never final. I followed him for three years. I healed others, asked impossible things, and watched him do things no teacher should be able to do. Then the rooster crowed. I denied him three times and left. I am still here, which is either resilience or foolishness. You decide.
* [Tell me about the donkey colt and the cloaks.] -> cloaks
* [What happened with the rope at the tethering post?] -> rope
=== cloaks ===
Those are mine and John's cloaks. We used them as a saddle for the colt because it had never been ridden — we didn't want it to bolt on the road. Simple as that.
* [Why leave them behind?] -> cloak_detail
* [That sounds rehearsed.] -> rope_lie
=== cloak_detail ===
We didn't leave them, exactly. We draped them over the colt and then... when the crowd started cheering and the whole Mount of Olives came alive, we were swept up in it. The cloaks were still on the animal. We just forgot them in the noise.
* [Go on.] -> closing
=== rope ===
John untied the rope — he didn't cut it. I don't know how it ended up cut. Maybe someone else came along later. We were in a hurry.
* [You cut it yourself.] -> rope_lie
* [I believe you.] -> cloak_detail
=== rope_lie ===
Alright — I cut the rope. Not to steal anything, but the knot had been tied extra tight and I was in a hurry. We were supposed to be back before the main crowd arrived. Everything else happened exactly as Jesus said.
* [Thank you, Peter.] -> closing
=== closing ===
The story ends here. But the work carries on.
