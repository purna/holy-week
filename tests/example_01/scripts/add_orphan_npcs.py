add_orphan_npcs.py — Add orphan NPC entries to actX_case_improved.js files.

This script scans the story/ directory for .ink files that are NOT referenced
in any actX_case_improved.js, and adds minimal NPC entries for them.

For orphans WITHOUT a .json file, it creates inline dialogue entries.
For orphans WITH a .json file, it references the JSON as storyFile.

Usage:
    python add_orphan_npcs.py              # add all orphan NPCs
    python add_orphan_npcs.py --dry-run    # preview only
    python add_orphan_npcs.py --reset      # remove previously added orphans
