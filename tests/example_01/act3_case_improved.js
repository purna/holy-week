  // ── BIBLICAL CONTEXT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  biblicalContext: {
    summary: `On Thursday evening, Nisan 14, Jesus and His disciples gathered in a borrowed upper room in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover meal. But this was no ordinary Passover — Jesus was about to transform a 1,500-year-old ceremony into something entirely new. He took the bread and wine that were already present for the Seder and reinterpreted them: the broken bread as His body, the wine as His blood — the New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31–34). This meal, the Last Supper, ended with Judas slipping away into the night to betray Him.`,
    significance: `The Passover lamb had always pointed forward to something greater. In Exodus 12, God told the Israelites to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doorposts with its blood — death would 'pass over' every house protected by the blood. Paul later wrote: 'Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed' (1 Corinthians 5:7). Jesus was intentionally eating the Passover on the night He became it.`,
    historicalNote: `The 'upper room' (Greek: anagaion) was likely in the southwestern upper city of Jerusalem — the wealthier quarter where larger houses with guest rooms existed. Peter and John were sent ahead to prepare (Luke 22:8), following a man carrying a water jar as their sign — unusual, since water-carrying was women's work, making such a man easy to spot. The host is unnamed in Scripture, though later tradition associates the house with John Mark's family (see Acts 12:12).`,

      gospelLink: "John 1:29; 1 Corinthians 5:7; Luke 22:15–20",
      insight: "The Passover lamb was to be 'without blemish' (Exodus 12:5). Jesus — declared righteous even by Pilate ('I find no fault in him', John 18:38) — perfectly fulfilled this requirement. The meal Jesus ate was the same meal that pointed to Him.",

      gospelLink: "Luke 22:20; 1 Corinthians 11:25",
      insight: "Jeremiah prophesied a coming covenant that would be internal, not external — written on hearts, not stone tablets. Jesus announced its inauguration over a cup of wine at Passover. The old covenant was sealed with animal blood (Exodus 24:8); the new with His own.",

  intro: `It is the evening of Nisan 14. In a large upper room in Jerusalem's southwestern quarter, Peter and John have spent all afternoon preparing for the Passover Seder. The unleavened bread is set. The cups of wine are poured. The Passover lamb is ready. But when Jesus and the twelve arrive for the meal, something is wrong: a cup has been broken, the wine from one goblet has been spilled across the tablecloth, and a portion of the unleavened bread is missing. Three people had access to the upper room that afternoon. Was this sabotage — or something far more significant?`,

Judas left immediately into the night to alert the Temple guards.",
    lesson: "Even the betrayal was prophesied. Psalm 41:9, Zechariah 11:12–13, and Isaiah 53:12 all pointed toward this moment centuries in advance.

  biblicalContext: {
    summary: `Late Thursday night, Judas led a cohort of Roman soldiers and temple officers to a private olive grove called Gethsemane. After identifying Jesus with a kiss, a scuffle broke out. Peter drew a short sword and cut off the ear of Malchus, the High Priest’s servant. Jesus immediately commanded Peter to put away his weapon, healed Malchus, and surrendered peacefully.`,
    significance: `This case highlights Jesus's absolute control over His arrest. He prohibited violent revolution, healed His enemy, and protected His disciples from capture, fulfilling His own word that He would lose none of them.`,
    historicalNote: `A Roman cohort combined with temple police shows a massive, coordinated security operation. The authorities expected armed resistance from Jesus's followers, making His peaceful surrender highly unexpected to military tacticians.`,
