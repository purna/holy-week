  biblicalContext: {
    summary: `Early on Sunday morning, Nisan 17, three days after the crucifixion, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb in the garden near Golgotha. She found the stone rolled away, the tomb empty, and — according to John's Gospel — initially thought the body had been stolen (John 20:2). But as the morning unfolded, multiple witnesses reported encounters with a risen Jesus: first Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11–18), then the other women (Matthew 28:9–10), then Peter (1 Corinthians 15:5), then two disciples on the Emmaus road (Luke 24:13–35), and finally the eleven apostles in a locked room (John 20:19–23).`,
    significance: `The resurrection is the pivotal claim of Christianity. Paul wrote: 'If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile' (1 Corinthians 15:17). But it was also the most precisely predicted event in the Passion narrative — Psalm 16:10, Hosea 6:2, Jonah 1:17, and Isaiah 53:10–11 all pointed toward it. Jesus himself predicted it three times (Matthew 16:21, 17:23, 20:19). The evidence at the tomb — the folded linens, the rolled stone, the guard report — all points toward something for which 'theft' is an inadequate explanation.`,
    historicalNote: `The tomb was a wealthy man's tomb — Joseph of Arimathea's, hewn from rock in the garden near Golgotha (John 19:41). This fulfilled Isaiah 53:9 ('buried with the rich'). A large stone (Greek: lithos) sealed the entrance — estimates suggest it weighed 1–2 tonnes. The Roman guard (koustodia) was a 4–16 man unit assigned to prevent exactly the situation they now had to report. Matthew 28:11–15 records that the chief priests bribed the soldiers to say the disciples stole the body while they slept — a story with obvious problems: soldiers asleep on duty faced execution; if they were asleep, how did they see what happened?`,

  intro: `It is early Sunday morning, Nisan 17. Three women — Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome — have come to the garden tomb at first light to complete the anointing of Jesus's body. They were worried about who would roll the stone away. But when they arrive: the stone is already moved. The Roman guard post is abandoned. The tomb is open, and empty. Two strange figures in white are inside. And then — Mary Magdalene sees someone she mistakes for the gardener, until He speaks her name. You are the investigative scribe. What happened here? And can the evidence in this garden account for the most important claim in history?`,

Paul's 1 Corinthians 15 list of witnesses does not mention her — he is addressing a Roman legal context in which women's testimony was inadmissible. The Gospels record her testimony because it actually happened, not because it was strategically useful.",

    culprit: "none",
    motive: "There was no theft, no conspiracy, and no staged event. Jesus rose from the dead on the third day exactly as He had predicted, fulfilling centuries of prophetic writing. The evidence at the tomb — the orderly linens, the impossibly moved stone, the terrified guards, the independent witnesses, the inability of the authorities to produce a body — all points toward one conclusion.",
    method: "The resurrection was a supernatural act of God. The stone was moved not to release Jesus — who later appeared in locked rooms — but to allow witnesses to see the empty tomb. The burial linens remained in their position, undisturbed. Multiple independent witnesses encountered the risen Jesus across the day: Mary Magdalene in the garden, the other women on the road, Peter, the Emmaus disciples, and finally all the apostles in the locked room.",
    lesson: "The resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian faith — and the most prophetically anticipated event in the Bible. Psalm 16:10, Hosea 6:2, Isaiah 53:10–11, Jonah 1:17, and Jesus's own three predictions all pointed to this morning. The evidence is not that everyone immediately believed — Peter was confused, Thomas doubted, the guards lied — but that the tomb remained empty, the body was never produced, and witnesses continued to report encounters with a risen Jesus despite having no earthly incentive to do so under Roman persecution.",

  biblicalContext: {
    summary: `Following the supernatural opening of the tomb, members of the Roman guard detail rushed into the city. Instead of reporting directly to Pilate—which would mean immediate execution for losing a post—they went to the chief priests. The Sanhedrin gave the soldiers a large sum of money, instructing them to spread a cover story: "His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep."`,
    significance: `This case exposes the extreme lengths to which the political apparatus went to manufacture a counter-narrative. The absurdity of the official cover story (witnessing a theft while completely unconscious) historically validates that the tomb was undeniably empty.`,
    historicalNote: `Under Roman military discipline (*Disciplinam Militarem*), sleeping on watch or failing to guard a sealed state target carried the mandatory penalty of being beaten or executed by crucifixion. Soldiers would never confess to sleeping unless guaranteed absolute political immunity from the highest levels.`,
