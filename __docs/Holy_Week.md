**Note on Suspects:** All characters begin as potential suspects. Lab research unlocks or removes suspects by proving innocence or guilt. Codex completion is optional for solving a case but required for 100% completion and the best ending.

This document serves as the canonical source of truth for the game's narrative structure, characters, and case resolutions for both mobile and desktop versions. It is generated from the `act*.js` case files.

## Prophecy & Typology System

Unlocking prophetic and typological insights is a key mechanics layer for scoring and narrative discovery.

### Categories in the Codex
1. **Fulfilled Prophecies:** Direct OT predictions matched with NT events (e.g., Zechariah 9:9).
2. **Typological Fulfilments (Types & Shadows):** Structural patterns where OT historical events foreshadow Christ (e.g., Passover Lamb sequence).

### Discovery Steps
1. **Reveal (Discovery):** Unlocked through NPC conversation or Lab analysis (`revealsProphecy`).
2. **Link (Codex):** Match revealed prophecy/type to its fulfilling evidence item (+10 points).
3. **Scoring:**
   - Correct Link: `+10 points`
   - Incorrect Link: `+5 doubt`


## Codex: Biblical Patterns Section

The Codex features a dedicated section for **Biblical Patterns & Typology**, distinguishing between predictive prophecies and typological fulfilments:

### Predictive Prophecies (Direct OT Predictions)

| Prophecy | Scripture | Category | Codex Entry |
|---|---|---|---|
| The Rejected City | Jeremiah 19:10–11; Daniel 9:26 | Prophecy | *The Rejected City* |
| The Rejected King | Psalm 2:1–6; Isaiah 8:14–15 | Prophecy | *The Rejected King* |
| The New Covenant | Jeremiah 31:31–34; Exodus 24:8 | Prophecy | *The New Covenant* |
| The Scattered Sheep | Zechariah 13:7 | Prophecy | *The Scattered Sheep* |
| The Silent Lamb | Isaiah 53:7; Psalm 27:12; Isaiah 50:6 | Prophecy | *The Silent Lamb* |
| Psalm 22 | Psalm 22:1, 7–8, 16, 18 | Prophecy | *Psalm 22 Fulfilled* |
| The Perfect Sacrifice | Zechariah 12:10; Exodus 12:46; Psalm 34:20 | Prophecy | *The Perfect Sacrifice* |
| The Unexpected Tomb | Isaiah 53:9 | Prophecy | *The Unexpected Tomb* |
| The Firstfruits of Resurrection | Leviticus 23:9–14; Psalm 16:10; Hosea 6:2; Isaiah 53:10–11 | Prophecy | *The Firstfruits of Resurrection* |

### Typological Fulfilments (Types & Shadows)

* **Passover Lamb** (Exodus 12)
* **Bronze Serpent** (Numbers 21)
* **Jonah** (Jonah 1)
* **Hyssop at Passover** (Exodus 12:22)
* **Manna** (Exodus 16)
* **Melchizedek** (Genesis 14)
* **Isaac Carrying the Wood** (Genesis 22)
* **Joseph Rejected then Exalted** (Genesis 37–45)
* **Day of Atonement / Scapegoat** (Leviticus 16)
* **Red Heifer** (Numbers 19)
* **Abel's Righteous Blood** (Genesis 4)
* **Rock Struck for Water** (Exodus 17)

## Typology Deep Dive: The Passover Lamb

### Case Details
* **ID:** `passover_lamb_chain` (Act II) & `crucifixion_site` (Act III)
* **Theme:** The detective discovers that Jesus is intentionally fulfilling the multi-day Passover Lamb sequence from Exodus 12.

### Evidence Items
*   🧴 **Flask of Nard (`nard_flask`):** Anointing of Jesus's feet at Bethany (John 12). *Typology: The anointing of Jesus's feet with expensive perfume was an act of profound worship. In the Old Testament, anointing with oil consecrated kings (1 Samuel 16:13) and priests (Exodus 30:30) for service. This act sets Jesus apart as the Messiah (the "Anointed One") and, as Jesus Himself stated, prepares His body "beforehand for burial" (Mark 14:8).*
*   🏺 **Broken Alabaster Jar (`alabaster_jar`):** Anointing of Jesus's head (Matthew 26). *Typology: The anointing of Jesus's head directly mirrors the way kings like Saul and David were anointed, signifying His royal authority. It also serves as a prophetic act of consecration, setting Him apart as the ultimate High Priest and King who would offer Himself as the final sacrifice.*
*   📜 **Temple Inspection Notes (`inspection_notes`):** Jesus is publicly questioned by priests and found without fault. *Typology: The lamb is inspected for four days.*
*   🌿 **Sponge Soaked in Sour Wine (`sour_wine_sponge`):** The sponge is lifted to Jesus on a hyssop branch at the cross (John 19:29). *Typology: Hyssop was used to apply the lamb's blood to the doorposts for salvation (Exodus 12:22).*

### Lab Mechanics & "Aha!" Moment
When players link evidence from across multiple cases (e.g., `nard_flask` + `alabaster_jar` + `sour_wine_sponge`), the game unlocks the hidden pattern:

> **Hidden Pattern Discovered:** 
> *Jesus is intentionally following the Passover Lamb sequence (Selection -&gt; Inspection -&gt; Anointing -&gt; Sacrifice).*


## Typology Deep Dive: The Priest-King of Salem

*   **Case:** `last_supper` (Act III)
*   **Evidence:** `Spilled Wine on the Linen` (`wine_stain`)
*   **Typology:** Melchizedek, the mysterious priest-king of Salem, blessed Abraham with bread and wine (Genesis 14:18). Jesus, as the ultimate priest-king (Hebrews 7), uses the same elements to establish the New Covenant, fulfilling this ancient pattern.


## Hidden Detective Chains

Hidden Detective Chains are **cross-case discovery patterns** that unlock bonus Codex entries when the player links all related evidence items from multiple cases. Each chain represents a complete theological arc spanning multiple days of Holy Week.

### Cross-Case Discovery Mechanics

Hidden chains are discovered through the **Codex** tab. When a prophecy from one case is linked to evidence from a *different* case that also relates to the same chain, a "Cross-Case Discovery" notification appears. Completing all links in a chain triggers the bonus Codex entry.

| Chain | Cross-Case Links | Trigger Point |
|---|---|---|
| Day of Atonement | `sanhedrin_trial`: `torn_robe` → `isaiah_50_6`, `barabbas_choice`: `barabbas_warrant` → scapegoat, `crucifixion_site`: `pierced_spear` → `zechariah_12_10` | After linking all 3 pieces of evidence |
| Passover Lamb | `passover_lamb_chain`: `nard_flask` / `alabaster_jar` → `typology_passover_lamb`, `last_supper`: `wine_stain` → `typology_melchizedek`, `crucifixion_site`: `unbroken_legs` → `psalm_34_20` | After linking evidence from 3 cases |
| New Covenant | `last_supper`: `bread_crumbs` → Exodus 12:1–14, `wine_stain` → Melchizedek typology, `new_covenant_declaration` → Jeremiah 31:31–34 | After linking all 3 Last Supper evidence |
| Resurrection | `crucifixion_site` → `resurrection`: `guard_report`, `opened_tombs`, `empty_tomb`, `mary_encounter` | After linking all 4 resurrection evidence |

# Prophecy Collection System

## Overview

The prophecy collection system allows players to discover and track biblical prophecies that are fulfilled throughout their investigation. Prophecies work similarly to evidence but are categorized separately and displayed in a dedicated Codex tab.

## Architecture

### Evidence Type Addition
- A new evidence type, `SCRIPTURE`, is added for scrolls and fragments.

### Case Manager Tracking
- A `prophecyStatus` object tracks the state of each prophecy: `'unseen'`, `'rumor'`, `'found_scripture'`, `'complete'`.

### NPC System Integration
- Dialogue with `revealsProphecy` sets the prophecy status to `'rumor'`.

### UI Changes
- Accuse tab renamed to "Codex"
- The Codex displays all prophecies, filterable by status (Rumor, Found, Complete).
- A "Biblical Scholar" level and "Research Score" are displayed.

### Prophecy Discovery Flow

A prophecy progresses through four stages before it is considered "Complete."

1.  **Stage 1: Rumor (Heard About)**
    *   **Action:** An NPC mentions a prophecy in dialogue.
    *   **Result:** A new, greyed-out entry appears in the Codex, often with a hidden title (e.g., "The Prophecy of the Pierced Shepherd").

2.  **Stage 2: Scripture (Found)**
    *   **Action:** The player finds the relevant scripture fragment or scroll as a piece of evidence.
    *   **Result:** The Codex entry updates to show the prophecy's text (e.g., "Zechariah 13:7"). It is marked as "Found" but remains incomplete.

3.  **Stage 3: Evidence (Matched)**
    *   **Action:** The player collects the piece of evidence that fulfills the prophecy (e.g., `Scattered Disciples' Cloaks`).
    *   **Result:** The evidence is now available for analysis. The Codex may show a checkmark indicating the fulfillment evidence has been found.

4.  **Stage 4: Research (Complete)**
    *   **Action:** In the Lab, the player correctly links the **Scripture Evidence** with the **Fulfillment Evidence**.
    *   **Result:** The research is marked complete. The full Codex entry unlocks, revealing its significance, historical context, and gospel links. This awards a significant amount of **Research Points**.

## Hidden Chains Integration

- Hidden Detective Chains span multiple cases
- `chainManager.js` tracks cross-case evidence-to-prophecy linkages
- `chainsCompleted` array stored in `caseState` per case
- Cross-case links trigger a "Discovery" notification in the Codex
- Completing a chain unlocks a bonus Codex entry and awards Faith

## Prophecy Data Structure

```javascript
{
  id: "zechariah_9_9",
  reference: "Zechariah 9:9",
  text: "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!...",

* **Story files present:** 79
* **Distinct `storyFile` references used:** 62
* **Story files NOT referenced by any act case (unused):** 18
* **`storyFile` references with NO matching file (orphans / broken links):** 1 — `chief_priest`

## ⚠️ Broken Reference (fixed)
* `js/act2_case.js` referenced `storyFile: "chief_priest"` (NPC id `chief_priest` = Caiaphas), but no `chief_priest.ink`/`.json` exists. The correct file is `caiaphas_priest`. **Corrected** in `js/act2_case.js:213` to `storyFile: "caiaphas_priest"` (act3 already used the correct name).

## Unused Story Files (present in `/story/` but not referenced in `act*_case.js`)

| Story File | Identity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `board_debate` | Board Debate (Senior Scribe) | System overlay / case-review interface |
| `board_review` | Board Review (Senior Scribe) | System overlay / case-review interface |
| `centurion_witness` | Centurion Longinus Witness | Crucifixion spear-thrust account |
| `excited_child_donkey` | Excited Child (Donkey) | Triumphal entry flavor |
| `guard_entry` | Guard — Entry | Antonia gate duty |
| `guard_report_crucifixion` | Guard — Crucifixion | Roman watch report variant |
| `guard_report_gethsemane` | Guard — Gethsemane | Arrest watch report variant |
| `guard_report_temple` | Guard — Temple | Cleansing watch report variant |
| `jesus_reinstatement` | Jesus Reinstatement (Peter) | John 21 restoration |
| `peter_reinstated` | Peter Reinstated | John 21 restoration variant |
| `pilate_interrogation` | Pilate Interrogation | Trial dialogue variant |
| `pontius_pilate_barabbas` | Pilate — Barabbas | Barabbas exchange variant |
| `pontius_pilate_temple` | Pilate — Temple | Temple-cleansing variant |
| `priest_objection_crucifixion` | Priest Objection — Crucifixion | Crucifixion variant |
| `priest_objection_temple` | Priest Objection — Temple | Temple variant |
| `rich_young_ruler` | Rich Young Ruler | Extra encounter |
| `roman_council` | Roman Council | Extra encounter |
| `roman_soldier` | Roman Soldier | Extra encounter |

## Notes
* Several unused files are **variant** dialogue trees (`*_crucifixion`, `*_temple`, `*_gethsemane`, `*_barabbas`, `pilate_interrogation`, `priest_objection_*`) that branch the same NPC but are not currently wired into the linear act cases.
* `board_debate` / `board_review` belong to the persistent investigation-board overlay rather than an act case, which is expected.
* The `chief_priest` → `caiaphas_priest` mismatch was the only broken link; it has been resolved.


### Lab Actions

The Lab is the primary tool for advancing the **Investigation**. Its role is to analyze evidence to generate deductions about suspects and the case, not to directly score prophecy points.

*   **Correct Pairing:** `+15 points`
    *   Awarded when the player combines the listed pair of evidence with the correct operation (Link or Compare) and reaches the stated Result. This is the same `+15 points` "Lab Deductions" reward listed under Score, above.
    *   **Reputation:** unaffected. Unlike NPC challenges, Lab deductions are private research and don't move any faction's trust — the Reputation column always reads `—`.
    *   **Prophecy:** If a pairing completes research on a prophecy, it awards **Research Points**, not Investigation Score.
*   **Incorrect Pairing:** `-5 points`, `+5 doubt`
    *   Applied whenever the player submits an evidence pair/operation that doesn't match any correct combination for that case.

### Doubt

Doubt is a global penalty meter that accumulates across all cases. It measures how many missteps the investigator has made.

*   **Starting Value:** `0`
*   **Minimum Value:** `0` (cannot go negative)
*   **Penalty Calculation:** The player's final case score is reduced by `Doubt × 2` points.
*   **Accrual Triggers:**
    *   **Failed Challenge:** `+10 doubt`
        *   Awarded when the player incorrectly pairs two pieces of evidence during an NPC challenge and no contradiction is found.
    *   **Incorrect Lab Pairing:** `+5 doubt`
        *   Awarded when the player submits an evidence pair/operation in the Lab that doesn't match any correct combination for the case. Also carries a `-5 point` penalty — see **Lab Actions** above.
    *   **Incorrect Prophecy Link:** `+5 doubt`
        *   Awarded when the player incorrectly links scripture to evidence in the Lab during the "Research" step.
    *   **Incorrect Accusation:** `+25 doubt`
        *   Awarded when the player accuses the wrong suspect (or 'No One') of a crime.

### Reputation

Reputation is a faction-based trust meter that tracks how each major group in Jerusalem views the investigator.

*   **Factions:**
    *   `scribes` — Religious scholars and teachers
    *   `temple` — Temple authorities and priests
    *   `roman` — Roman military and administrative officials
    *   `local` — Local Jerusalem residents and merchants
*   **Starting Value:** `100` per faction
*   **Range:** `0` to `100` (clamped on change)
*   **Displayed Value:** The UI shows the **average** of all four faction reputations as a single number.
*   **Change Triggers:**
    *   **Successful Challenge:** `+5` to the challenged NPC's faction
        *   Awarded when the player correctly exposes a contradiction without having previously failed that challenge.
    *   **Failed Challenge:** `-15` to the challenged NPC's faction
        *   Awarded when the player incorrectly challenges an NPC and fails to find a contradiction.

## Core Gameplay Systems

### Inventory & Evidence System

The player's inventory consists of **Evidence** collected during an investigation. Evidence is the primary resource used for making deductions, challenging witnesses, and linking events to prophecies.

*   **Collection:** Evidence is discovered by exploring the 2D/3D scene, interacting with objects, and talking to witnesses.
*   **Management:** Collected evidence is accessible through the **Evidence** tab (or "Lab" tab in some versions). From here, players can review details or select items for analysis.
*   **Usage:**
    *   **Lab:** Combine two pieces of evidence to make a deduction.
    *   **People:** Show evidence to a witness to get a reaction.
    *   **Codex:** Link evidence to a revealed prophecy to score points.

### Actions System

A new **Actions** tab is available on the main investigation screen, providing access to thematic and spiritual actions that deepen the player's connection to the narrative.

*   **Purpose:** To provide immersive, non-investigative interactions that reinforce the game's spiritual themes.
*   **Current Actions:**
    *   **🙏 Pray:** The player can offer a prayer for guidance. This triggers a visual effect of a floating icon, representing a moment of reflection.
    *   **❤️‍🩹 Heal:** A context-sensitive action representing spiritual restoration. It provides a visual effect and could be used in specific cases (like "The Severed Ear") to confirm a miracle.
*   **Gameplay:** These actions are currently for atmospheric effect and do not directly impact scoring or case progression. They are accessible from the "Actions" tab in the main investigation UI for all game versions (`/desktop/`, `/mobileB/`, `/mobileC/`).

## Canonical Runtime Dialogue ID Reference (Auto-Generated)


This section is generated from `js/act*_case.js` + `js/gameplay/dialogueMaps.js` and reflects the **actual runtime mapping**.

- Dialogue cache key is case-scoped at runtime: `caseId::npcId`.
- `dialogueKey` is resolved from: `npc.storyFile || npc.dialogueId || npc.id`.
