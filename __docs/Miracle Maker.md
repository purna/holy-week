# Miracle Maker - Source of Truth

**Note on Suspects:** All characters involved in a case are considered potential suspects from the start. The final list of accusable suspects is fully unlocked once all prophecies for that case have been discovered.

This document serves as the canonical source of truth for the game's narrative structure, characters, and case resolutions for both mobile and desktop versions. It is generated from the `act*.js` case files.

## Prophecy System: How Prophecies are Unlocked

Prophecies are a key element for scoring and understanding the narrative. Unlocking them is a two-step process: **Reveal** and **Link**.

1.  **Reveal (Discovery):** First, a prophecy must be revealed. This removes the padlock in the Codex, allowing you to read its details. A prophecy is revealed when you:
    *   **Talk to a specific person:** Certain characters will mention a prophecy during dialogue, revealing it.
    *   **Perform an analysis in the Lab:** Combining the correct evidence in the Lab can also reveal a prophetic connection.

    Each NPC and lab deduction that reveals a prophecy is marked with a `revealsProphecy` field in the case data. When triggered, a "🔮 Prophecy Revealed" notification appears.

2.  **Link (Unlock for Score):** Once a prophecy is revealed, you must go to the Codex to unlock its point value. To do this, you must correctly link the prophecy to the piece of evidence that fulfills it.

3.  **Scoring:**
    *   Open the Codex.
    *   Select the unlocked prophecy.
    *   Correctly link it to the piece of evidence that fulfilled it.
    *   A correct link awards `+10 points`. An incorrect link adds `+5 doubt`.

A "Prophecy Revealed" notification (🔮) will appear when you successfully complete step 1.

## Scoring System

The player's performance in each case is evaluated based on a comprehensive scoring system designed to reward thorough investigation and careful deduction. The final score for a case is calculated when the player submits an accusation.

The score is composed of the following elements:

### Score
*   **Correct Accusation:** `+50 points`
    *   Awarded for correctly identifying the culprit (or 'No One' if it was a prophetic act). An incorrect accusation results in a `-25 point` penalty.
*   **Lab Deductions:** `+15 points` per deduction
    *   Awarded for successfully analyzing evidence in the Lab to reveal its implication on a suspect (e.g., clearing them, implicating them, or identifying them as a witness). Each case's Lab table lists the exact Points/Reputation/Doubt outcome per pairing — see **Lab Actions** below.
*   **Prophecies Linked:** `+10 points` per prophecy
    *   Awarded for correctly matching evidence to prophecies in the Codex.
*   **Successful Challenges:** `+10 points` per breakthrough
    *   Awarded for successfully challenging an NPC with a contradiction, leading to a breakthrough.
*   **Evidence Collected:** `+5 points` per item
    *   Rewards finding all available physical evidence and testimonials.
*   **Perfect Case Bonus:** `+25 points`
    *   A bonus awarded if the accusation is correct and the player made no failed challenges during the case.
*   **Doubt Penalty:** `-2 points` per doubt point
    *   The player's final score for the case is reduced by a penalty calculated from their accumulated "Doubt" score.


# Prophecy Collection System

## Overview

The prophecy collection system allows players to discover and track biblical prophecies that are fulfilled throughout their investigation. Prophecies work similarly to evidence but are categorized separately and displayed in a dedicated Codex tab.

## Architecture

### Evidence Type Addition
- PROPHECY is added to EVIDENCE_TYPES in evidenceSystem.js
- Prophecies have id, type, icon, location, desc fields
- Evidence can reference related prophecies via `relatedProphecy` field
- NPC reactions can reveal prophecies via `revealsProphecy` field

### Case Manager Tracking
- `propheciesFound` array tracks discovered prophecy IDs per case
- `recordProphecyFound(prophecyId)` method records discoveries
- Progress saved to localStorage under `cases[id].propheciesFound`

### NPC System Integration
- `showEvidence()` checks for `revealsProphecy` in reactions
- `challenge()` checks for `revealsProphecy` in contradictions
- Prophecies unlocked through investigation and deduction

### UI Changes
- Accuse tab renamed to "Codex"
- Codex shows discovered prophecies grouped by case
- Prophecy detail view shows full reference, text, and fulfillment info
- Completion percentage shown for each case's prophecy collection

## Implementation Pattern

Prophecies follow the same discovery pattern as evidence:
1. Player shows evidence to NPC
2. NPC reaction may include `revealsProphecy: "prophecy_id"`
3. System marks prophecy as discovered
4. Prophecy appears in Codex tab

## Prophecy Data Structure

```javascript
{
  id: "zechariah_9_9",
  reference: "Zechariah 9:9",
  text: "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!...",
  written: "~520 BC",
  fulfilledBy: "Jesus riding a donkey colt into Jerusalem",
  gospelLink: "Matthew 21:4-5; John 12:14-15",
  insight: "The donkey was not a practical choice...",
  icon: "🔮",
  location: "Bethphage, Mount of Olives",
  type: "PROPHECY"
}
```

# 🔍 Cross-Reference: Story Files vs. `js/act*_case.js`

Generated audit of dialogue story files (`story/extras/*.ink` + `story/system/*.ink`) against `storyFile` references in `js/act1_case.js`, `js/act2_case.js`, `js/act3_case.js`, and `js/act4_case.js`.

* **Story files present:** 79
* **Distinct `storyFile` references used:** 62
* **Story files NOT referenced by any act case (unused):** 18
* **`storyFile` references with NO matching file (orphans / broken links):** 1 — `chief_priest`

## ⚠️ Broken Reference (fixed)
* `js/act2_case.js` referenced `storyFile: "chief_priest"` (NPC id `chief_priest` = Caiaphas), but no `chief_priest.ink`/`.json` exists. The correct file is `caiaphas_priest`. **Corrected** in `js/act2_case.js:213` to `storyFile: "caiaphas_priest"` (act3 already used the correct name).

## Unused Story Files (present in `/story/` but not referenced in `act*_case.js`)

| Story File | Identity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `board_debate` | Board Debate (Senior Scribe) | System overlay / case-review interface |
| `board_review` | Board Review (Senior Scribe) | System overlay / case-review interface |
| `centurion_witness` | Centurion Longinus Witness | Crucifixion spear-thrust account |
| `excited_child_donkey` | Excited Child (Donkey) | Triumphal entry flavor |
| `guard_entry` | Guard — Entry | Antonia gate duty |
| `guard_report_crucifixion` | Guard — Crucifixion | Roman watch report variant |
| `guard_report_gethsemane` | Guard — Gethsemane | Arrest watch report variant |
| `guard_report_temple` | Guard — Temple | Cleansing watch report variant |
| `jesus_reinstatement` | Jesus Reinstatement (Peter) | John 21 restoration |
| `peter_reinstated` | Peter Reinstated | John 21 restoration variant |
| `pilate_interrogation` | Pilate Interrogation | Trial dialogue variant |
| `pontius_pilate_barabbas` | Pilate — Barabbas | Barabbas exchange variant |
| `pontius_pilate_temple` | Pilate — Temple | Temple-cleansing variant |
| `priest_objection_crucifixion` | Priest Objection — Crucifixion | Crucifixion variant |
| `priest_objection_temple` | Priest Objection — Temple | Temple variant |
| `rich_young_ruler` | Rich Young Ruler | Extra encounter |
| `roman_council` | Roman Council | Extra encounter |
| `roman_soldier` | Roman Soldier | Extra encounter |

## Notes
* Several unused files are **variant** dialogue trees (`*_crucifixion`, `*_temple`, `*_gethsemane`, `*_barabbas`, `pilate_interrogation`, `priest_objection_*`) that branch the same NPC but are not currently wired into the linear act cases.
* `board_debate` / `board_review` belong to the persistent investigation-board overlay rather than an act case, which is expected.
* The `chief_priest` → `caiaphas_priest` mismatch was the only broken link; it has been resolved.


### Lab Actions

Every case's Lab table includes **Points**, **Reputation**, and **Doubt** columns showing exactly what each pairing awards:

*   **Correct Pairing:** `+15 points`
    *   Awarded when the player combines the listed pair of evidence with the correct operation (Link or Compare) and reaches the stated Result. This is the same `+15 points` "Lab Deductions" reward listed under Score, above.
    *   **Reputation:** unaffected. Unlike NPC challenges, Lab deductions are private research and don't move any faction's trust — the Reputation column always reads `—`.
    *   **Prophecy:** if the pairing also unlocks a prophecy, that's a notification only; the `+10 points` for a prophecy is earned separately when it's linked in the Codex.
*   **Incorrect Pairing:** `-5 points`, `+5 doubt`
    *   Applied whenever the player submits an evidence pair/operation that doesn't match any correct combination listed for that case. This isn't listed as its own row in every table — it's a standing rule that applies to any mismatch, in every case.

### Doubt

Doubt is a global penalty meter that accumulates across all cases. It measures how many missteps the investigator has made.

*   **Starting Value:** `0`
*   **Minimum Value:** `0` (cannot go negative)
*   **Penalty Calculation:** The player's final case score is reduced by `Doubt × 2` points.
*   **Accrual Triggers:**
    *   **Failed Challenge:** `+10 doubt`
        *   Awarded when the player incorrectly pairs two pieces of evidence during an NPC challenge and no contradiction is found.
    *   **Incorrect Lab Pairing:** `+5 doubt`
        *   Awarded when the player submits an evidence pair/operation in the Lab that doesn't match any correct combination for the case. Also carries a `-5 point` penalty — see **Lab Actions** above.
    *   **Incorrect Prophecy Link:** `+5 doubt`
        *   Awarded when the player links evidence to the wrong prophecy in the Codex.
    *   **Incorrect Accusation:** `+25 doubt`
        *   Awarded when the player accuses the wrong suspect (or 'No One') of a crime.

### Reputation

Reputation is a faction-based trust meter that tracks how each major group in Jerusalem views the investigator.

*   **Factions:**
    *   `scribes` — Religious scholars and teachers
    *   `temple` — Temple authorities and priests
    *   `roman` — Roman military and administrative officials
    *   `local` — Local Jerusalem residents and merchants
*   **Starting Value:** `100` per faction
*   **Range:** `0` to `100` (clamped on change)
*   **Displayed Value:** The UI shows the **average** of all four faction reputations as a single number.
*   **Change Triggers:**
    *   **Successful Challenge:** `+5` to the challenged NPC's faction
        *   Awarded when the player correctly exposes a contradiction without having previously failed that challenge.
    *   **Failed Challenge:** `-15` to the challenged NPC's faction
        *   Awarded when the player incorrectly challenges an NPC and fails to find a contradiction.

## Core Gameplay Systems

### Inventory & Evidence System

The player's inventory consists of **Evidence** collected during an investigation. Evidence is the primary resource used for making deductions, challenging witnesses, and linking events to prophecies.

*   **Collection:** Evidence is discovered by exploring the 2D/3D scene, interacting with objects, and talking to witnesses.
*   **Management:** Collected evidence is accessible through the **Evidence** tab (or "Lab" tab in some versions). From here, players can review details or select items for analysis.
*   **Usage:**
    *   **Lab:** Combine two pieces of evidence to make a deduction.
    *   **People:** Show evidence to a witness to get a reaction.
    *   **Codex:** Link evidence to a revealed prophecy to score points.

### Actions System

A new **Actions** tab is available on the main investigation screen, providing access to thematic and spiritual actions that deepen the player's connection to the narrative.

*   **Purpose:** To provide immersive, non-investigative interactions that reinforce the game's spiritual themes.
*   **Current Actions:**
    *   **🙏 Pray:** The player can offer a prayer for guidance. This triggers a visual effect of a floating icon, representing a moment of reflection.
    *   **❤️‍🩹 Heal:** A context-sensitive action representing spiritual restoration. It provides a visual effect and could be used in specific cases (like "The Severed Ear") to confirm a miracle.
*   **Gameplay:** These actions are currently for atmospheric effect and do not directly impact scoring or case progression. They are accessible from the "Actions" tab in the main investigation UI for all game versions (`/desktop/`, `/mobileB/`, `/mobileC/`).
