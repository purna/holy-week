=== start ===
You are wasting your time with these questions, scribe. I am Eleazar. I saw the whole 'procession' from my villa's upper terrace. It was nothing more than a band of lawless Galileans causing a disturbance.
* [What exactly did you see at the tethering post?] -> theft_claim
* [The people were celebrating, not rioting.] -> aristocrat_view

=== theft_claim ===
I saw two of them — likely the ones they call the 'sons of thunder' given the noise they were making. They drew a blade, hacked through the rope, and made off with the colt. The owner was clearly terrified.
* [The rope fibers don't look hacked.] -> rope_evasion

=== aristocrat_view ===
They went toward the gate, dragging the beast along. They were throwing their dirty cloaks in the mud as if the street were a palace floor. It is an insult to the dignity of Jerusalem.
* [Why do you dislike this teacher so much?] -> threat_path

=== rope_evasion ===
Hacked, cut, untied — what does it matter? The animal was removed without a proper transaction. In the eyes of the Law, that is theft.
* [Continue.] -> closing

=== closing ===
Keep your notes, scribe. But remember: a movement built on a borrowed donkey will not last the week. The Sanhedrin will handle this.-> DONE
