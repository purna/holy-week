//
// BACKGROUND:
//   On the evening of Nisan 14, Jesus and His disciples gathered
//   in a borrowed upper room to celebrate the Passover. During
//   the preparations, investigators discover a broken clay cup,
//   spilled wine, missing bread, and evidence that someone was
//   acting nervously before the meal began. What initially appears
//   to be sabotage or theft becomes the setting for one of the
//   most significant moments in biblical history: Jesus institutes
//   the Lord's Supper, announces the New Covenant in His blood,
//   identifies His betrayer, and reveals that every event unfolding
//   has already been foretold in Scripture. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

//
//   • Psalm 41:9

//
//   • Isaiah 53:12
//     Jesus is numbered with transgressors and intercedes for

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// BIBLICAL CONTEXT:
//
//   Summary:
//   During the Passover meal Jesus transforms the traditional
//   Seder into the institution of the Lord's Supper. The bread
//   represents His body, the cup His blood of the New Covenant,
//   and Judas's betrayal is revealed as part of God's redemptive
//   plan rather than an unexpected tragedy.
//
//   Historical Context:
//   Passover commemorated Israel's deliverance from Egypt through
//   the blood of the lamb. The upper room was a prepared guest
//   chamber in Jerusalem where Peter and John made the necessary
//   arrangements. The meal followed the traditional Passover
//   pattern, allowing Jesus to reveal Himself as the fulfillment
//   of its symbols. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
//
//   Spiritual Theme:
//   Redemption, covenant, sacrifice, betrayal, and God's sovereign
//   plan fulfilled through Christ.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// CASE FACTS (Truth Object)
//
//   Crime:
//     Apparent sabotage of the Passover preparations involving a
//     broken cup, spilled wine, and missing bread.
//
//   Actual Event:
//     Judas, already committed to betraying Jesus, handled the
//     money bag before the meal, left in haste after being
//     identified by Jesus, while Jesus instituted the New Covenant
//     through the bread and the cup. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
//
//   Culprit:
//     Judas Iscariot. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
//
//   Motive:
//     Having accepted thirty pieces of silver from the chief
//     priests, Judas was preparing to betray Jesus and departed

//
//   Verdict:
//     The physical disturbances in the upper room were incidental
//     to Judas's betrayal. The true significance of the evening
//     was the fulfillment of multiple Messianic prophecies and the

  // ── BIBLICAL CONTEXT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  biblicalContext: {
    summary: `On Thursday evening, Nisan 14, Jesus and His disciples gathered in a borrowed upper room in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover meal. But this was no ordinary Passover — Jesus was about to transform a 1,500-year-old ceremony into something entirely new. He took the bread and wine that were already present for the Seder and reinterpreted them: the broken bread as His body, the wine as His blood — the New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31–34). This meal, the Last Supper, ended with Judas slipping away into the night to betray Him.`,
    significance: `The Passover lamb had always pointed forward to something greater. In Exodus 12, God told the Israelites to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doorposts with its blood — death would 'pass over' every house protected by the blood. Paul later wrote: 'Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed' (1 Corinthians 5:7). Jesus was intentionally eating the Passover on the night He became it.`,
    historicalNote: `The 'upper room' (Greek: anagaion) was likely in the southwestern upper city of Jerusalem — the wealthier quarter where larger houses with guest rooms existed. Peter and John were sent ahead to prepare (Luke 22:8), following a man carrying a water jar as their sign — unusual, since water-carrying was women's work, making such a man easy to spot. The host is unnamed in Scripture, though later tradition associates the house with John Mark's family (see Acts 12:12).`,

    motive: "Judas Iscariot had already made his agreement with the chief priests for 30 silver coins. He came to the preparation area before the meal to count his payment, dropping the clay cup in his haste. The broken cup and spilled wine were caused by his agitated state — and by his abrupt departure after Jesus identified him through the dipped bread.",
    method: "Judas moved through the preparation room before the Passover meal began, handling the money bag containing his payment. His nervous energy caused the cup to be knocked and broken near the doorway. During the meal, Jesus gave him the honoured sop of dipped bread — publicly naming him as the betrayer, though only John fully understood. Judas left immediately into the night to alert the Temple guards.",
    lesson: "Even the betrayal was prophesied. Psalm 41:9, Zechariah 11:12–13, and Isaiah 53:12 all pointed toward this moment centuries in advance. Jesus did not merely endure the betrayal — He identified it from Scripture, gave Judas one final act of grace (the honored bread), and then let the plan of God proceed.",

//
// BACKGROUND:
//   Late on Thursday night, Judas Iscariot led a combined force
//   of Roman soldiers and Temple officers to the Garden of
//   Gethsemane to arrest Jesus. After identifying Him with a kiss,
//   Simon Peter drew a sword and struck Malchus, the High Priest's
//   servant, severing his ear. Instead of encouraging resistance,
//   Jesus immediately rebuked Peter, healed Malchus's wound, and
//   surrendered peacefully. What appears to be the beginning of an
//   armed rebellion instead becomes a demonstration of Christ's
//   complete authority, mercy, and willing obedience to the will
//   of the Father. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// PROPHECIES FULFILLED:
//
//   • Zechariah 13:7
//     "Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered."
//     Jesus foretold that His disciples would flee when He was
//     arrested, and the prophecy was fulfilled that very night.
//
//   • Isaiah 53:7
//     "Like a lamb led to the slaughter..."
//     Jesus willingly submitted to arrest without resisting,
//     fulfilling Isaiah's portrait of the suffering Servant.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// BIBLICAL CONTEXT:
//
//   Summary:
//   Judas betrays Jesus in Gethsemane, Peter attempts to defend
//   Him with a sword, but Jesus heals His enemy, commands peace,
//   protects His disciples, and voluntarily surrenders to those
//   sent to arrest Him.
//
//   Historical Context:
//   The arresting force consisted of Roman soldiers working
//   alongside Temple police, expecting violent resistance.
//   Instead, Jesus took complete control of the encounter,
//   preventing bloodshed and ensuring His disciples escaped while
//   He willingly fulfilled the Father's plan. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
//
//   Spiritual Theme:
//   Obedience, peace, mercy, sacrificial submission, and the
//   fulfillment of God's sovereign plan.

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// CASE FACTS (Truth Object)
//
//   Crime:
//     Apparent armed resistance against the lawful arrest of Jesus.
//
//   Actual Event:
//     Peter attacked Malchus with a sword, but Jesus immediately
//     healed the injury, stopped further violence, and willingly
//     surrendered to the arresting authorities. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
//
//   Culprit:
//     None. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
//
//   Motive:
//     Jesus refused to establish His kingdom through violence,

//
//   Verdict:
//     No military uprising occurred. Jesus deliberately submitted
//     to arrest, healed His enemy, and fulfilled the Scriptures,
//     proving that His death was an act of willing sacrifice rather
//     than defeat. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

    summary: `Late Thursday night, Judas led a cohort of Roman soldiers and temple officers to a private olive grove called Gethsemane. After identifying Jesus with a kiss, a scuffle broke out. Peter drew a short sword and cut off the ear of Malchus, the High Priest’s servant. Jesus immediately commanded Peter to put away his weapon, healed Malchus, and surrendered peacefully.`,
    significance: `This case highlights Jesus's absolute control over His arrest. He prohibited violent revolution, healed His enemy, and protected His disciples from capture, fulfilling His own word that He would lose none of them.`,

// ACT: Act III
// CASE: The Midnight Tribunal
// CASE ID: sanhedrin_trial
// CASE EXPORT: act3CaseC
// SOURCE: act3_case.js
//
// LOCATION:
//   High Priest's Courtyard, Jerusalem
//
// DIFFICULTY:
//   3
//
// BACKGROUND:
//   Following His arrest in Gethsemane, Jesus was brought before
//   Caiaphas and an illegally convened session of the Sanhedrin.
//   Under cover of darkness, false witnesses were recruited in an
//   attempt to secure a conviction. Their testimony repeatedly
//   contradicted itself until the High Priest directly questioned
//   Jesus concerning His identity. When Jesus affirmed that He was
//   the Messiah, Caiaphas tore his robes and declared Him guilty
//   of blasphemy. Meanwhile, outside in the courtyard, Peter denied
//   knowing Jesus three times before the rooster crowed, exactly as
//   Jesus had foretold.
//
// BIBLE REFERENCES:
//   Matthew 26:57–75
//   Mark 14:53–72
//   Luke 22:54–71
//   John 18:12–27
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// PROPHECIES FULFILLED:
//
//   • Isaiah 50:6
//     "I offered my back to those who beat me... I did not hide
//     my face from mocking and spitting."
//     Fulfilled as Jesus endured abuse, mockery, and spitting
//     following the Sanhedrin's verdict.
//
//   • Micah 5:1
//     Israel's ruler would be struck and humiliated.
//     Fulfilled as Jesus remained silent before His accusers and
//     was mocked and beaten after His condemnation.
//
//   • Psalm 27:12
//     "False witnesses rise up against me."
//     Fulfilled through the conflicting testimony presented by
//     the Sanhedrin.
//
//   • Psalm 35:11
//     "Malicious witnesses rise up; they ask me of things that
//     I do not know."
//     Fulfilled through the fabricated accusations brought
//     against Jesus.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// BIBLICAL CONTEXT:
//
//   Summary:
//   The Sanhedrin conducted an illegal night trial, relying on
//   false testimony to condemn Jesus. Although the witnesses
//   failed to agree, Caiaphas obtained the verdict by demanding
//   that Jesus declare His identity. Outside, Peter's three
//   denials marked the lowest point of the disciples' faithfulness.
//
//   Historical Context:
//   Jewish law prohibited capital trials at night and during
//   major feast periods. The hurried proceedings in the High
//   Priest's residence demonstrate that the outcome had already
//   been decided before evidence was heard.
//
//   Spiritual Theme:
//   False justice, fulfilled prophecy, human failure, and the
//   unwavering obedience of the Suffering Servant.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// CASE FACTS (Truth Object)
//
//   Crime:
//     Illegal religious trial using false witnesses to secure a
//     charge of blasphemy.
//
//   Actual Event:
//     The Sanhedrin manufactured testimony, pressured Jesus into
//     declaring His identity, and condemned Him, while Peter
//     fulfilled Jesus's prediction by denying Him three times.
//
//   Culprit:
//     Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin leadership.
//
//   Motive:
//     To obtain a blasphemy charge that could be used as political
//     leverage to persuade the Romans to execute Jesus.
//
//   Verdict:
//     Jesus was unlawfully condemned through a procedurally
//     illegal trial built on contradictory testimony, fulfilling
//     multiple Messianic prophecies while demonstrating His
//     willing submission to the Father's plan.

    summary: `Following the arrest in Gethsemane, Jesus was taken to the house of Caiaphas. In an illegal midnight session, the Sanhedrin sought false testimony to condemn Him.

Outside in the courtyard, Peter denied Jesus three times, punctuated by the crowing of the rooster.`,

// ACT: Act III
// CASE: The People's Choice
// CASE ID: barabbas_choice
// CASE EXPORT: act3CaseD
// SOURCE: act3_case.js
//
// LOCATION:
//   Praetorium, Jerusalem
//
// DIFFICULTY:
//   3
//
// BACKGROUND:
//   On the morning of Passover, Pontius Pilate sought a way to
//   release Jesus after repeatedly declaring that He had committed
//   no crime deserving death. Following the Passover custom,
//   Pilate offered the crowd a choice between Jesus and Barabbas,
//   a notorious insurrectionist, murderer, and robber. Stirred up
//   by the chief priests, the crowd demanded Barabbas's release
//   and called for Jesus to be crucified. Though warned by his
//   wife's troubling dream and convinced of Jesus's innocence,
//   Pilate yielded to public pressure, symbolically washing his
//   hands before authorizing the execution.
//
// BIBLE REFERENCES:
//   Matthew 27:15–26
//   Mark 15:6–15
//   Luke 23:13–25
//   John 18:38–40
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// PROPHECIES FULFILLED:
//
//   • Isaiah 53:3
//     "He was despised and rejected by mankind..."
//     Fulfilled when the crowd publicly rejected the Messiah and
//     chose the release of Barabbas instead.
//
//   • Psalm 2:1–2
//     "The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band
//     together against the LORD and against His Anointed."
//     Fulfilled as Pilate, Herod, and the Jewish authorities
//     united in condemning Jesus despite His innocence.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// BIBLICAL CONTEXT:
//
//   Summary:
//   Pilate offered the people a choice between Jesus and
//   Barabbas. Influenced by the religious leaders, the crowd
//   demanded the freedom of a violent revolutionary while
//   rejecting the Prince of Peace.
//
//   Historical Context:
//   During Passover the Roman governor customarily released one
//   prisoner as an act of goodwill. Barabbas was imprisoned for
//   insurrection and murder, making the crowd's choice a striking
//   contrast between earthly revolution and God's Kingdom.
//   Pilate attempted to avoid responsibility but ultimately
//   surrendered justice to political pressure.
//
//   Spiritual Theme:
//   Rejection of the Messiah, substitution, political compromise,
//   and humanity's preference for worldly power over God's
//   salvation.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// CASE FACTS (Truth Object)
//
//   Crime:
//     Apparent miscarriage of justice during the Roman trial.
//
//   Actual Event:
//     Religious leaders manipulated the crowd into demanding the
//     release of Barabbas while Pilate condemned an innocent Jesus
//     despite publicly acknowledging His innocence.
//
//   Culprit:
//     None.
//
//   Motive:
//     The crowd, influenced by the chief priests, preferred a
//     political revolutionary over the suffering Messiah, while
//     Pilate sacrificed justice to preserve public order.
//
//   Verdict:
//     No criminal conspiracy by Barabbas determined the outcome.
//     The rejection of Jesus fulfilled Messianic prophecy and
//     demonstrated humanity's willingness to exchange innocence
//     for violence.

// ACT: III — The Passion
// CASE: The Final Sacrifice
// CASE ID: crucifixion_site
// CASE EXPORT: act3CaseE
// SOURCE: act3_case.js
//
// LOCATION:
// Golgotha (Calvary), outside the walls of Jerusalem
//
// DIFFICULTY:
// ★★★ (3/3)
//
// BACKGROUND:
// Following His condemnation by Pilate, Jesus was led to Golgotha and
// crucified between two criminals under Roman authority. During the
// crucifixion, extraordinary events occurred: darkness covered the land,
// Jesus died after several hours on the cross, the Temple veil was torn,
// the earth shook, rocks split, and His side was pierced instead of His
// legs being broken. Joseph of Arimathea then requested His body and
// buried Him in his own new tomb.
//
// BIBLE REFERENCES:
// Matthew 27:32–61
// Mark 15:21–47
// Luke 23:26–56
// John 19:16–42
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// PROPHECIES FULFILLED:
//
// • Psalm 22:16–18 — Hands and feet pierced; soldiers cast lots for
//   His garments.
// • Amos 8:9 — Supernatural darkness at midday.
// • Isaiah 53:9 — Buried with the rich despite dying among criminals.
// • Zechariah 12:10 — His side was pierced.
// • Psalm 34:20 / Exodus 12:46 — None of His bones were broken.
// • Psalm 31:5 — "Into Your hands I commit My spirit."
// • Jeremiah 31:31–34 — The torn Temple veil symbolized the New Covenant.
// • Haggai 2:6–7 — Earthquake accompanying God's redemptive work.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// BIBLICAL CONTEXT:
//
// Summary:
// Jesus willingly gave His life as the perfect sacrifice for humanity's
// sin. His death fulfilled numerous Messianic prophecies simultaneously,
// demonstrating that the crucifixion was not an accident of history but
// the culmination of God's redemptive plan.
//
// Historical Context:
// Roman crucifixion was reserved for the empire's worst criminals and
// rebels. Executions were public displays intended to deter rebellion.
// Because Passover Sabbath was approaching, the authorities hurried the
// process, leading to the spear thrust that confirmed Jesus' death
// without breaking His legs.
//
// Spiritual Theme:
// The Cross represents God's justice and mercy meeting together.
// Christ became the true Passover Lamb, opening direct access to God.
// The torn veil, darkness, earthquake, and fulfilled prophecies all
// testify that His death changed both history and eternity.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// CASE FACTS (Truth Object)
//
// Crime:
// Crucifixion under Roman authority following an unjust conviction.
//
// Actual Event:
// Jesus voluntarily laid down His life on the cross, fulfilling numerous
// Old Testament prophecies while supernatural signs confirmed the
// significance of His death.
//
// Culprit:
// No human culprit alone. Roman authorities carried out the execution,
// Jewish leaders orchestrated the charges, but the crucifixion ultimately
// fulfilled God's redemptive plan.
//
// Motive:
// To accomplish humanity's redemption through the sacrificial death of
// the Messiah and establish the New Covenant.
//
// Verdict:
// The physical evidence—including the darkness, earthquake, torn Temple
// veil, unbroken bones, pierced side, soldiers casting lots, and burial
// in a rich man's tomb—consistently confirms the Gospel accounts and the
// fulfillment of multiple Messianic prophecies.

  biblicalContext: {
    summary: `On Friday morning, Nisan 14, Jesus was led out of Jerusalem to a rocky hill called Golgotha to be executed between two insurrectionists. For three hours, an eerie, supernatural darkness covered the entire land. At 3:00 PM, Jesus cried out and gave up His spirit. Instantly, a localized earthquake ripped through Judea, splitting rocks, opening tombs, and tearing the massive Temple veil clean in two from top to bottom. To accelerate burial before the Sabbath sunset, a Roman soldier pierced His side, yielding an unexpected flow of blood and water.`,
    significance: `This case records the ultimate paradox of the Passion Week: an execution meant to act as a public deterrent of Roman shame became the epic center of cosmic and theological transformation. The tearing of the heavy Temple curtain declared that the barrier between God and humanity had been permanently removed, while the unbroken bones identified Jesus as the true Passover Lamb.`,
    historicalNote: `Crucifixion squads under Pontius Pilate were highly efficient, professional units. The execution details were tightly managed, making the accompanying seismic rifts, sudden midday darkness, and structural Temple failures deeply disruptive anomalies to veteran legionaries and Temple priests alike.`,
