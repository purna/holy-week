  // ── BIBLICAL CONTEXT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  biblicalContext: {
    summary: `On Nisan 10 (Palm Sunday), Jesus sent two disciples ahead to Bethphage to collect a donkey colt that had never been ridden. This was no coincidence — it was the precise fulfilment of a 500-year-old prophecy from Zechariah 9:9. The crowds who lined the road were waving palm branches (a symbol of Jewish national victory, last used during the Maccabean revolt), spreading cloaks on the road — royal carpet treatment — and crying "Hosanna!" (meaning "Save us now!"), quoting directly from Psalm 118:25–26.`,
    significance: `The triumphal entry deliberately echoed how King Solomon entered Jerusalem for his coronation (1 Kings 1:33–35), riding on a donkey down the Mount of Olives. Every Jewish bystander would have understood the royal claim being made. The Pharisees were alarmed: "Look, the whole world has gone after him!" (John 12:19).`,
    historicalNote: `Bethphage was a small priestly village on the Mount of Olives, roughly 1km from Jerusalem. It sat on the boundary of Jerusalem's sacred precincts. Jesus's knowledge of where the donkey was — and the pre-arranged answer for anyone who questioned the disciples ("The Lord needs it") — suggests either divine foreknowledge or a pre-arrangement with a sympathiser, though Scripture presents it as prophetic foreknowledge.`,

  intro: formatIntro(`It is Palm Sunday morning, Nisan 10. Jesus and His disciples have spent the night in Bethany and are now walking toward Jerusalem. Two disciples were sent ahead to the village of Bethphage with specific instructions: untie a donkey colt they would find there, and if anyone challenged them, say only **"The Lord needs it."** But when you arrive at the tethering post — the colt is gone, a rope has been cut, and three people were seen in the area. Was it stolen? Or is something else _entirely_ happening here?`),

  biblicalContext: {
    summary: `On Monday morning, Jesus entered the Temple courts and forcefully drove out those who were buying and selling. He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the benches of those selling doves, declaring: "My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers."`,
    significance: `By halting the commercial exploitation in the Court of the Gentiles, Jesus disrupted the high-priestly financial monopoly. More importantly, He acted out a prophetic sign of judgment against an institutional temple system that had locked out the nations from genuine prayer.`,
    historicalNote: `The moneychangers exchanged common Roman and Greek coins for high-purity Tyrian shekels—the only currency accepted for the mandatory temple tax. The currency exchange rates and high costs of sacrificial animals created massive revenue for the Sadducean family of Annas.`,

  // ── BIBLICAL CONTEXT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  biblicalContext: {
    summary: `On Monday morning, as Jesus and His disciples walked from Bethany to Jerusalem, Jesus saw a fig tree with leaves but no fruit. He cursed it, saying, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." The next morning, Tuesday, as they passed by, the disciples noticed the fig tree had withered from the roots. This acted as a living parable, a prophetic sign of judgment on unfruitful Israel and a powerful lesson on the authority of faith and prayer.`,
    significance: `The fig tree, often a symbol for Israel in the Old Testament, represented outward religious appearance without inward spiritual fruit. Jesus's action was a dramatic visual sermon, foreshadowing judgment on a religious system that had become barren. It also taught the disciples about the power of faith-filled prayer.`,
    historicalNote: `Fig trees typically produce fruit before leaves. A tree with leaves but no fruit was deceptive, promising what it could not deliver. This made it a perfect symbol for the religious establishment of the day, which had the outward appearance of piety but lacked genuine spiritual fruit.`,

  intro: formatIntro(`It is Tuesday morning. As Jesus and His disciples walk from Bethany back to Jerusalem, Peter points to a fig tree they had passed yesterday. It was full of leaves then, but now it is **completely withered** from the roots. The disciples are astonished. Was this a mere coincidence, a natural phenomenon, or something _far more profound_? The withered tree stands as a silent witness, demanding an explanation.`),
