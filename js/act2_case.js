//
// BACKGROUND:
// On the Tuesday of Passion Week, Jesus returned to the Temple after
// cleansing it the previous day. The chief priests, elders, Pharisees,
// Sadducees, Herodians, and scribes launched a coordinated series of
// public challenges designed to discredit Him before the crowds.
// Instead, every trap was answered with perfect wisdom, exposing the
// hypocrisy of His opponents while affirming His divine authority.
// By the end of the day, no one dared question Him further.

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// PROPHECIES FULFILLED:
//
// • Psalm 118:22–23 — The rejected stone becomes the cornerstone.
//
// • Isaiah 5:1–7 — The Song of the Vineyard fulfilled through the
//   Parable of the Wicked Tenants.
//
// • Daniel 7:13–14 — The Son of Man possesses everlasting authority
//   and dominion.
//
// • Malachi 3:1 — The Lord comes suddenly to His Temple after His
//   messenger prepares the way.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// BIBLICAL CONTEXT:
//
// Summary:
// Religious leaders publicly challenged Jesus's authority, hoping to
// trap Him into making a statement that could justify His arrest.
// Jesus answered every challenge with wisdom, exposed their motives,
// taught several parables of judgment, and revealed Himself as the
// rejected Cornerstone foretold in Scripture.
//
// Historical Context:
// This confrontation took place during Passion Week in the Temple
// courts of Jerusalem, where thousands of pilgrims had gathered for
// Passover. Public debates between rabbis were common, but this was
// an organised attempt by the Sanhedrin and allied religious groups
// to undermine Jesus before the crowds.
//
// Spiritual Theme:
// Divine authority, truth confronting hypocrisy, wisdom, judgment,
// the rejection of God's Messiah, and the fulfilment of prophecy.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// CASE FACTS (Truth Object)
//
// Crime:
// Conspiracy to publicly discredit and undermine Jesus's authority.
//
// Actual Event:
// Religious leaders coordinated a series of theological and political
// traps concerning authority, taxation, resurrection, and the Law.
// Jesus answered every question flawlessly, revealed their hypocrisy,
// and declared Himself to be the rejected Cornerstone promised in
// Scripture.
//
// Culprit:
// Caiaphas and the religious leadership of the Sanhedrin.
//
// Motive:
// To preserve their religious authority, political influence, and
// control over the people while preventing the crowds from accepting
// Jesus as the Messiah.
//
// Verdict:
// The conspiracy failed completely. Jesus's wisdom silenced every
// challenger, confirmed His divine authority, and fulfilled multiple
// Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah.

  biblicalContext: {
    summary: `On Tuesday morning, Nisan 12, Jesus returned to the Temple courts for His most intensive day of public teaching. The religious leadership — stung by the Temple cleansing the day before and alarmed by the growing crowds — mounted a coordinated series of challenges designed to discredit Him publicly. They sent Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, and scribes in waves. Each trap backfired. Each time, Jesus's answer not only escaped the trap but turned the tables, exposing the questioner's hypocrisy, ignorance, or bad faith. By afternoon, 'no one dared ask him any more questions' (Matthew 22:46).`,
    significance: `The authority question ('By what authority do you do these things?') was the most direct challenge. Jesus answered with a counter-question about John the Baptist's authority that left them publicly paralysed — they couldn't say divine, because they hadn't believed John; they couldn't say human, because the crowd would be furious. Their own trap snapped shut on them. Jesus then delivered three devastating parables against them (the Two Sons, the Wicked Tenants, the Wedding Banquet) followed by the Parable of the Cornerstone — quoting Psalm 118:22 directly at them.`,
    historicalNote: `The 'Temple courts' (Greek: hieron) referred to the vast outer courts of Herod's Temple complex — particularly the Court of the Gentiles. This was a public, noisy, commercially active space where teachers would gather disciples and debate. Jesus taught here daily during Passion Week. The size of the audience made public defeats deeply humiliating for the religious leaders.`,

      gospelLink: "Matthew 21:42–44; Mark 12:10–11",
      insight: "The 'builders' were Israel's religious leaders, entrusted with building God's community. The 'stone' was Jesus, whom they were rejecting. Jesus used their own Scripture to declare their judgement — He was the very stone they were trying to remove, and His rejection would become the cornerstone of something entirely new: the Church.",
      explanation: "Jesus quoted this coronation psalm directly at the religious leaders ('the builders'), identifying Himself as the cornerstone of God's new work, which they were in the process of rejecting.",

      insight: "When Jesus began His parable 'There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, set a hedge around it, dug a winepress...' — He was quoting Isaiah 5 almost word-for-word. Every Pharisee in the crowd recognised it immediately. The tenants who killed the owner's son were unmistakably them. Matthew records: 'When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them' (Matthew 21:45).",

      insight: "The title 'Son of Man' was Jesus's preferred self-designation — it is used over 80 times in the Gospels. It came from Daniel 7:13 and carried unmistakable divine authority claims. The religious leaders understood exactly what He was claiming — which is why the high priest tore his robes at Jesus's trial when He quoted it (Mark 14:62–64).",

      insight: "The authority challenge asked where Jesus's authority came from. Jesus's counter-question about John's authority was strategic — if John was God's messenger (Malachi 3:1), and John had publicly identified Jesus as the Coming One (John 1:29–34), then Jesus's authority derived from the very God who had sent His messenger ahead.

  intro: formatIntro(`It is Tuesday morning, Nisan 12. The Temple courts are packed with Passover pilgrims and local worshippers.

// ACT: II — Growing Opposition
// CASE: The Price of Life
// CASE ID: lazarus_plot
// CASE EXPORT: act2CaseB
// SOURCE: John 11:45–57; John 12:9–11
//
// LOCATION:
// Bethany & Temple Courts, Jerusalem
//
// DIFFICULTY:
// ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)
//
// BACKGROUND:
// After Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead following four days in the
// tomb, news spread rapidly throughout Jerusalem during Passover.
// Instead of celebrating the miracle, the chief priests and Pharisees
// feared that the growing crowds would strengthen belief in Jesus and
// provoke Roman intervention. The Sanhedrin secretly agreed that both
// Jesus and Lazarus had become threats to their authority, leading to
// an unprecedented conspiracy to eliminate not only the miracle worker,
// but also the living evidence of the miracle itself.
//
// BIBLE REFERENCES:
// John 11:45–57
// John 12:9–11
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// PROPHECIES FULFILLED:
//
// • Isaiah 25:8 — God would swallow up death forever, previewed by the
//   raising of Lazarus from the grave.
//
// • Psalm 16:10 — God's Holy One would not ultimately remain under the
//   power of death, foreshadowed through Jesus's authority over the tomb.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// BIBLICAL CONTEXT:
//
// Summary:
// The resurrection of Lazarus became the turning point that convinced
// the religious leaders they must act against Jesus. Rather than denying
// the miracle, they sought to silence its evidence by plotting the deaths
// of both Jesus and Lazarus.
//
// Historical Context:
// Bethany lay less than two miles from Jerusalem, making Lazarus easily
// accessible to the thousands of Passover pilgrims entering the city.
// His public resurrection generated enormous attention, creating intense
// political anxiety among the Temple leadership, who feared Roman
// retaliation if the crowds proclaimed Jesus as Messiah.
//
// Spiritual Theme:
// Victory over death, unbelief despite overwhelming evidence, fear versus
// faith, corruption of power, and God's sovereign plan unfolding through
// human opposition.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// CASE FACTS (Truth Object)
//
// Crime:
// Secret conspiracy to murder an innocent witness and suppress evidence
// of a divine miracle.
//
// Actual Event:
// Following Lazarus's resurrection, the Sanhedrin secretly resolved to
// eliminate both Jesus and Lazarus. Their objective was to destroy the
// living testimony that was leading many people to believe in Christ.
//
// Culprit:
// Caiaphas and the chief priests of the Sanhedrin.
//
// Motive:
// To preserve political stability, protect their religious authority,
// and prevent the growing influence of Jesus from provoking Roman
// intervention and weakening their control.
//
// Verdict:
// The conspiracy confirmed the hardness of the religious leaders' hearts.
// Rather than accepting God's power over death, they chose to oppose it,
// setting in motion the events leading to Jesus's crucifixion while
// unknowingly advancing God's plan of salvation.

// ACT: II — Prophecy & Preparation
// CASE: The End of the Age
// CASE ID: olivet_discourse
// CASE EXPORT: act2CaseC
// SOURCE: Matthew 24–25; Mark 13; Luke 21
//
// LOCATION:
// Mount of Olives, overlooking Jerusalem
//
// DIFFICULTY:
// ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
//
// BACKGROUND:
// On Tuesday afternoon of Passion Week, Jesus departed the Temple and
// crossed the Kidron Valley to the Mount of Olives. Looking back at the
// magnificent Temple, He foretold its complete destruction. Privately,
// Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked when these events would occur
// and what signs would announce His coming and the end of the age.
// Jesus responded with His longest prophetic discourse, describing false
// messiahs, wars, persecution, worldwide evangelism, the destruction of
// Jerusalem, His future return, and the need for constant spiritual
// readiness through parables such as the Ten Virgins and the Talents.
//
// BIBLE REFERENCES:
// Matthew 24–25
// Mark 13
// Luke 21
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// PROPHECIES FULFILLED:
//
// • Daniel 9:27 — Jesus identifies the "abomination of desolation"
//   spoken of by Daniel as a future sign connected with Jerusalem.
//
// • Joel 2:30–31 — Cosmic disturbances preceding the Day of the Lord
//   are echoed in Jesus's description of His return.
//
// • Isaiah 13:10 — The darkening of the heavenly bodies is repeated by
//   Jesus as part of His end-times prophecy.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// BIBLICAL CONTEXT:
//
// Summary:
// Jesus answered His disciples' questions concerning the destruction of
// the Temple, the signs preceding His return, and the end of the age.
// His discourse combines near-term prophecy, fulfilled in the destruction
// of Jerusalem in AD 70, with future events surrounding His second coming,
// urging believers to remain faithful and watchful.
//
// Historical Context:
// The Mount of Olives provided a panoramic view of Jerusalem and the

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// CASE FACTS (Truth Object)
//
// Crime:
// None. This case investigates prophetic teaching rather than a criminal

//
// Actual Event:
// Jesus revealed future events concerning Jerusalem, the end of the age,

// Culprit:
// None.

// To prepare His disciples for coming persecution, strengthen their

  // ── BIBLICAL CONTEXT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  biblicalContext: {
    summary: `On Tuesday afternoon, after leaving the Temple courts, Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives with His disciples, overlooking Jerusalem. They asked Him about the destruction of the Temple and the signs of His coming and the end of the age. In response, Jesus delivered a lengthy and complex discourse, warning them of false messiahs, wars, famines, earthquakes, and persecutions, and urging them to be watchful and ready. He also taught parables like the Ten Virgins and the Talents, emphasizing preparedness and faithful stewardship.`,
    significance: `The Olivet Discourse is Jesus's most extensive teaching on eschatology (the study of end times). It provides crucial insights into the future, blending prophecies about the destruction of Jerusalem (fulfilled in AD 70) with prophecies about His second coming. It emphasizes the need for spiritual vigilance and perseverance amidst tribulation.`,
    historicalNote: `The Mount of Olives offered a panoramic view of the Temple and Jerusalem, providing a dramatic backdrop for Jesus's prophecies about its destruction. The disciples' questions were likely prompted by Jesus's earlier declaration that not one stone of the Temple would be left upon another (Matthew 24:2).`,

// LOCATION:
// Bethany (the house of Simon the Leper) & the Temple Courts, Jerusalem
//
// DIFFICULTY:
// ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)
//
// Actual Event:
// Six days before Passover, Mary of Bethany anoints Jesus's feet with
// a pound of pure nard — perfume worth a year's wages — and wipes them
// with her hair. Days later, at Simon the Leper's house, a woman
// (traditionally identified with the same act, though Matthew and Mark
// place it nearer the Supper) breaks an alabaster jar of ointment over
// Jesus's head. Read together with His public inspection in the Temple
// courts, the sequence traces the same four-stage pattern God gave
// Israel for the Passover lamb in Exodus 12: Selection, Inspection,
// Anointing, Sacrifice.
//
// Culprit:
// None — this is an act of worship, not a crime. The tension in the
// case is Judas's objection to the "waste," which John's Gospel
// reveals was self-interest rather than concern for the poor.
//
// Motive:
// Mary and the woman at Simon's house acted out of extravagant,
// unguarded devotion. Judas's complaint exposes the contrast between
// worship that costs something and religion that merely calculates.
//
// Verdict:
// Jesus receives both anointings as preparation for His burial,
// identifying Himself as the true Passover Lamb — set apart, publicly
// examined and found without fault, anointed for consecration, and
// finally offered as the sacrifice.

  biblicalContext: {
    summary: `In the days before Passover, at a dinner in Bethany, a woman broke open a flask of pure nard — perfume worth a full year's wages — and anointed Jesus, first at His feet and again at His head, wiping His feet with her own hair. Judas Iscariot objected loudly to the "waste." Jesus silenced the complaint: she had done it to prepare His body for burial. Meanwhile, in the Temple courts, Jesus was being publicly cross-examined by the chief priests, scribes, and elders — questioned, tested, and found without fault (Mark 11:27–33; Luke 20:1–8).`,
    significance: `Exodus 12 gave Israel a precise four-day sequence for the Passover lamb: it was selected on the 10th of Nisan, kept and inspected for blemishes until the 14th, then slaughtered at twilight. Read together, the anointing at Bethany and the public inspection in the Temple trace that same sequence over Jesus: Selection (His entry into Jerusalem), Inspection (the Temple questioning), Anointing (Bethany), and — days later — Sacrifice (the cross).`,
    historicalNote: `Spikenard (nard) was an imported aromatic oil from the Himalayas, sold in sealed alabaster flasks precisely because breaking the seal meant using the whole thing at once — there was no resealing it. A pound of it, as John 12:3 specifies, was worth roughly 300 denarii, close to a full year's wages for a laborer. Simon the Leper, the dinner's host, was likely someone Jesus had healed; his willingness to host a public dinner suggests he was no longer considered ceremonially unclean.`,

  intro: formatIntro(`It is evening in Bethany, and the house of Simon the Leper is full of guests, lamplight, and the smell of roasting food. Jesus reclines at the table with His disciples — including a very much alive Lazarus. Then, without warning, a woman kneels at His feet with a sealed alabaster flask. She breaks it open. The scent of pure nard fills the entire house. Some at the table are moved to silence. One man is furious. **Why would anyone waste something so valuable?** And in the days before this, in the Temple courts across the valley, Jesus had already faced a very different kind of scrutiny — question after question, trap after trap, testing whether He could be found at fault. Two scenes, two kinds of examination. Only one investigator in the room seems to sense they're connected.`),

  truth: {
    culprit: "none",
    motive: "Mary of Bethany, and separately the woman at Simon's table, gave the most costly thing they owned in an act of worship — anointing Jesus at both feet and head in the days before Passover. Judas's objection revealed his own self-interest rather than a genuine concern for the poor.",
    method: "The anointing at Bethany, read together with Jesus's public inspection in the Temple courts, traces the same Selection-Inspection-Anointing-Sacrifice sequence God gave Israel for the Passover lamb in Exodus 12 — fulfilled not in an animal, but in a person.",
    lesson: "Worship that costs nothing is not the same as worship at all. Jesus received the anointing as both an act of devotion and prophetic preparation for His burial, identifying Himself as the true Passover Lamb in the days before He was sacrificed.",
